blobLumper
==========

Sore and Retrieve images, files or any blob which is also scalable horizontally. Almost in every application we have to store files/images the problem is we have to do it effieciently.


Key features:
1. Horizontally scalable.
2. Maintains only one copy of a file. That means if a new blob already exists it should not store it again with different name.
3. Auto replicable.
